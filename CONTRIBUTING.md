## Contributing

There are a lot of room for improvement on this project. Some of my suggestion are:
* Change top bar to search bar instead of the app name (`FacebookProfile`)

* Make some of the text like the workplace, university, ... bold and clickable

* Add white border around the images
* Add more content like social link, post, ...

So please feels free to contribute to this project. Just create a Pull Request and I will review it under a day. I don't really have much time to improve this fun-side project but for I will sure try to fit some of my time for it ;).
