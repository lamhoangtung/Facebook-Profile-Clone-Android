# Facebook Profile Clone on Android

This is a Facebook Profile Screen clone on Android, I made this as a homework assignment for the **Java and Android** course in my university club **HIT** at faculty of **Information Technology** in **Hanoi University of Industry (HAUI)**. This also is the first attemp at understanding how `xml` work and how to create the UI of an Android application, eventhrough my main interest is on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**.

I made this basic application using mainly `ConstraintLayout`, `LinearLayout`, `TextView`, `ImageView` and `ScrollView`. Everything is kinda scaleable, I've tested it on a `5.0, 1080 x 1920, 420dpi (Pixel)` and a `6.0, 1440 x 2560, 560dpi (Pixel 2XL)` and it's working great. It scrollable but don't have and function or clickable button yet.

## Contributing

There are a lot of room for improvement on this project. Some of my suggestion are:
* Change top bar to search bar instead of the app name (`FacebookProfile`)

* Make some of the text like the workplace, university, ... bold and clickable
